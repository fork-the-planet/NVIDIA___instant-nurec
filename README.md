### Abstract

Reconstructing dynamic outdoor scenes from autonomous-vehicle driving
logs traditionally requires lengthy per-scene optimization. InstantNuRec
takes a different route: a feed-forward transformer directly infers a
dynamic 3D-Gaussian scene representation in a single forward pass.
Given a short window of multi-camera observations from an AV log, the
model emits a Gaussian primitive per pixel — covering geometry,
appearance, and per-Gaussian motion — which can be rendered in real
time and interchanged with existing simulation pipelines.

This repo goes from ncorev4 ingest → frame batch prep → forward pass
→ 3D-Gaussian PLY export. The PLY output is usable directly as a
static reconstruction, and can also serve as initialization for
downstream NuRec training to reach higher fidelity.

Instant-NuRec and
[NuRec](https://docs.nvidia.com/nurec/nurec/reconstruct-av-scene.html)
share the same input (NCore V4 clip / HF dataset / sequence `.json`)
but run on different runtimes: Instant-NuRec is a native-Python
feed-forward preview (seconds per clip); NuRec is a Docker-based
per-scene refinement pipeline that produces a high-fidelity USDZ.

### Background

Instant NuRec is a feed-forward reconstruction model that converts
driving logs into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations. Its
vision-transformer backbone and DPT-decoders output a high-fidelity
3D environment that's ready for simulations.

Instant NuRec leverages the following foundational technologies:
[Depth-Anything-V3](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/depth-anything-3),
[STORM](https://github.com/NVlabs/GaussianSTORM), and
[BTimer](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/bullet-timer/).

## User Guide

<summary><b>Setup</b></summary>

#### Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.11
- **NVIDIA driver and GPU VRAM** — see the
  [NuRec Hardware Setup and Requirements](https://docs.nvidia.com/nurec/basics/hardware.html#hardware-setup-and-requirements)
  page; Instant-NuRec inherits the same minimums.
- **uv** — the [Astral Python package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
  Install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` or
  `pip install uv`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/instant-nurec.git
cd instant-nurec
./setup.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

`setup.sh` runs `uv sync --frozen`, which installs the locked dependency
tree from `uv.lock` into `.venv/`. The only CUDA dependency is whatever
the pinned `torch` wheel ships with.

This repo is native-Python only — no Docker required. If you want a
container, use the standard
[NuRec](https://docs.nvidia.com/nurec/nurec/reconstruct-av-scene.html)
image as a generic CUDA environment.

#### Download Model Checkpoints [optional]

> **Note:** `instant_nurec.pt` is auto-downloaded into the Hugging Face
> hub cache on the first inference run.

However, you can also manually download the model into a directory of
your choice:

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub[cli]
hf auth login
hf download nvidia/instant-nurec --local-dir checkpoints
```

This places the following file in `checkpoints/`:

    checkpoints/
    └── instant_nurec.pt

Point the pipeline at this local copy by exporting:

```bash
export INSTANT_NUREC_FULL_PT="$(pwd)/checkpoints/instant_nurec.pt"
```

<summary><b>Inference</b></summary>

> **Note:** The pretrained model `instant_nurec.pt` (a TorchScript
> archive) is fetched on first inference run from the Hugging Face
> repo `nvidia/instant-nurec` and cached locally; subsequent runs read
> it from the cache. Set `INSTANT_NUREC_FULL_PT` to a local path to
> override the auto-download.

##### First run — end-to-end on a public demo clip

The clip lives in a gated HF dataset. Accept the terms at
[nvidia/PhysicalAI-Autonomous-Vehicles-NCore](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/PhysicalAI-Autonomous-Vehicles-NCore)
while logged into Hugging Face, then `hf auth login` locally; the same
auth covers the `nvidia/instant-nurec` model auto-download on first run.

```bash
# Download the clip (~2 GB)
hf download \
    nvidia/PhysicalAI-Autonomous-Vehicles-NCore --repo-type dataset \
    --include "clips/000da9de-0ee5-465a-9a2d-e7e91d3016bb/*" \
    --local-dir ./demo_clip

# Reconstruct it
python run_inference.py \
    --ncore-path ./demo_clip/clips/000da9de-0ee5-465a-9a2d-e7e91d3016bb/pai_000da9de-0ee5-465a-9a2d-e7e91d3016bb.json \
    --output-dir ./demo_output \
    --merge
```

Success looks like a single PLY at
`./demo_output/<run_id>/ply/pai_000da9de-.../pai_000da9de-....ply` —
~1.88 M Gaussians, kl-optimal voxelized from 2.87 M merged (3.18 M
pre-merge across 2 chunks) to land in `[0.9 * --n-gaussians,
--n-gaussians]` (default target 2 M). Omit `--merge` to write
per-chunk PLYs instead (voxelization is bundled with merge and
runs only when the flag is set).

##### View your output

The PLY is a **3DGS** PLY (Gaussian Splatting), not a point cloud —
generic viewers like MeshLab / macOS Preview will fail to open it.
Use one of:

- [SuperSplat](https://playcanvas.com/supersplat/editor) — browser, no install.
- `ply_viewer` — shipped in the NuRec container.

`--ncore-path` accepts two input shapes:

##### Mode 1 — single sequence `.json` (NuRec-aligned)

The path is treated as one ncorev4 sequence metadata file.
This matches NuRec's own input convention.

```bash
./run.sh \
    --ncore-path /path/to/clips/<uuid>/pai_<uuid>.json \
    --output-dir /tmp/out
```

##### Mode 2 — `.lst` manifest (batch)

The path is treated as a list of sequence JSON paths, one per line.
Each line may be absolute, relative-to-the-LST-file's directory, or
`~/`-prefixed; lines starting with `#` and blank lines are skipped;
mixed absolute + relative entries in a single LST are supported.

```
# example_manifest.lst
/abs/path/to/clips/<uuid_a>/pai_<uuid_a>.json
relative/path/to/clips/<uuid_b>/pai_<uuid_b>.json
~/symlinked/clips/<uuid_c>/pai_<uuid_c>.json
```

```bash
./run.sh \
    --ncore-path /path/to/example_manifest.lst \
    --output-dir /tmp/out \
    --merge
```

`run.sh` validates the input + output paths and execs
`python run_inference.py`. You can also call the CLI directly:

```bash
python run_inference.py \
    --ncore-path /path/to/sequence.json \
    --output-dir /tmp/out
```

Output layout: PLYs only, under `out_dir/<run_id>/ply/<sequence_id>/...ply`.

#### CLI reference

| flag | default | purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--ncore-path` | (required) | A `.json` file (single sequence) or a `.lst` manifest (one JSON path per line). |
| `--output-dir` | (required) | Directory the pipeline writes PLYs into. |
| `--merge` | absent (false) | Boolean flag. When set, merges per-chunk primitives into a single frustum-ownership PLY per sequence (`<seq>.ply`) and runs kl-optimal voxelization (target count from `--n-gaussians`). Absent (default): per-chunk PLYs (`<seq>_chunk{N}.ply`), no voxelization. |
| `--n-gaussians` | `2000000` | Target number of static Gaussians after voxelization. Only consulted when `--merge` is set. The voxel size is searched iteratively via bracketed binary search to land the count in `[0.9 * target, target]`. |
| `--camera-id` | `camera_front_wide_120fov` | ncorev4 context-camera id used as model input. Exactly one camera is required. |
| `--max-chunks` | `8` | Maximum number of time-chunks processed per clip. One chunk spans up to 13.5 s, so the default covers 8 × 13.5 = 108 s. Longer clips are truncated and a `WARNING` is logged naming the dropped chunk count and the `--max-chunks` value needed to cover the full clip — bump to `ceil(clip_seconds / 13.5)` to silence it. |
| `--log-level` | `INFO` | `DEBUG` / `INFO` / `WARNING` / `ERROR` / `CRITICAL`. |

#### Environment variables

| variable | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `INSTANT_NUREC_FULL_PT` | Absolute path to a local `instant_nurec.pt`. Takes priority over the auto-downloaded copy. |
| `INSTANT_NUREC_RUN_ID` | Override the per-run shortuuid; useful when scripting reproducible output paths. |

## What's next?

The PLY you just wrote is usable directly as a static reconstruction.
If you want a high-fidelity, fully-trained scene, feed the PLY into
[NuRec](https://docs.nvidia.com/nurec/nurec/reconstruct-av-scene.html)
as initialization for per-scene refinement.

## Support

chunk-prep, `--max-chunks` truncation), see
[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md). Anything not listed there:
file a GitHub issue with the full traceback, `nvidia-smi`, and
